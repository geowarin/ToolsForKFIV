# Tools For King's Field IV/TAC

A console based tool for exploring and extracting data files from King's Field IV / King's Field: The Ancient City.

Fork from https://github.com/TheStolenBattenberg/ToolsForKFIV

Changes:
 
- Updated to .NetCore
- Removed the GUI
- Export maps to GLTF
- Preview maps with OpenGL

### Software Support
Obviously only King's Field IV is supported, though as for the specific region support, NTSC (SLUS-20318, SLUS-20353) and NTSC-J (SLPS-25057) are fully supported, PAL (SLES-50920) is currently only partially supported. You can still access all the data of a PAL copy, but you'll only be able to see the English translations.

### Format Definitions
You'll find detailed descriptions and C style documentation for the file formats [on the wiki](https://github.com/TheStolenBattenberg/ToolsForKFIV/wiki) section of the repository, that can be used to implement these file formats in your own projects. Fair warning, wiki info tends to lag behind a lot and the latest findings will always be found in the source code only.
